                        <p>Our class had to work on the scenario of working with a rental agency to build a user friendly command
                            line interface Python application to manage the sales, inventory, and revenue for the company.
                            We all had to work on this project by ourselves and come up with our own solution to the problem.
                            Also, no project could be exactly similar so that meant we could not copy our classmates work
                            and use it in our own which was the most difficult part for the class in my opinion. <a href='https://github.com/Sfreeman99/Rental_Store'
